# Challenges

1. Using multiple cursors, export a new `Person` instance variable for each name provided in the [challenge](./challenge). Joe has already been done for you

2. **Without** using multiple cursors, rename the properties of the `Person` interface as below without introducing any errors to the rest of the file

```typescript
export interface Person {
  firstName: string; // `forename` > `firstName`
  lastName: string; // `surname` > `lastName`
}
```
