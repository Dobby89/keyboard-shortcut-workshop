# Challenges

1. Using multiple cursors, export a variable for each animal in the list
   - The first variable has been done for you
   - Each variable must have a suffix of `Food`, e.g. `const elephantFood = ...`
   - `getAnimalFood()` expects the argument to be lowercase and singular:
     - ✅ `getAnimalFood('elephant')`
     - ❌ `getAnimalFood('Elephants')`
